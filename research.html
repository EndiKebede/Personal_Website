          <h2>1) How do fine-scale irrigation dynamics shape water scarcity and hydrologic sustainability under climate stress?</h2>
          <p>
            Irrigated agriculture sustains nearly 40% of global food production yet remains the largest consumer of freshwater,
            driving depletion of surface and groundwater reserves in many regions. However, the hydrologic implications of
            irrigation are poorly quantified due to limited fine-scale data on where, when, and how irrigation occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on my current work developing global irrigation datasets, I will use AI-enabled remote sensing and multi-source
            satellite imagery to map irrigation intensity and timing at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. By integrating these
            data with hydrological and crop models (e.g., CWatM, WaterGAP2e), I will quantify consumptive water use, irrigation
            efficiency, and groundwater recharge deficits under varying climate and management scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach links the spatial footprint of irrigation to basin-scale water balance dynamics—diagnosing when and where
            irrigation transitions from sustainable use to hydrologic stress. I will also evaluate how improved irrigation scheduling,
            water-saving technologies, or crop-switching strategies can mitigate scarcity while maintaining productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal is to provide decision-relevant tools that connect irrigation management to measurable outcomes in water
            availability and ecosystem resilience.

          <h2>2) How is global water scarcity evolving, and what are the impacts on food production and supply?</h2>
          <p>
            Global water scarcity has become a critical challenge for billions of people, impacting numerous regions and threatening
            sustainable development and livelihoods. Because water is essential for food production—and dependent on local and global
            food demands—the implications of different forms of water scarcity (green, blue, economic) can be felt across scales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Past assessments of water scarcity in the context of food systems have been limited by outdated datasets and have failed
            to connect places of production with locations of final consumption. Leveraging the latest global monthly crop-specific data
            on irrigated and rainfed areas (MIRCA-OS), I conduct a comprehensive two-part assessment of the evolution of global water
            scarcity.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I quantify physical and economic limitations to crop production by assessing crop-specific exposure to blue and green
            water scarcity, the persistence of economic water scarcity, and its driving factors. Second, I evaluate the evolution of
            global water risk in relation to food supply and nutrition, leveraging bilateral food trade matrices to connect food
            production and supply in water-scarce regions with places of consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            This work highlights water scarcity exposure of crop-specific production baskets, the economic and infrastructural factors
            limiting irrigation expansion, and the water risks faced by local and distant consumers who rely on scarce water resources.

          <h2>3) How do climate change and urban growth drive water competition between cities and agriculture?</h2>
          <p>
            Climate change is fundamentally altering rainfall patterns, intensifying droughts, and diminishing reliable water supplies.
            Concurrently, rapid urban growth is dramatically increasing municipal water demand, often at the direct expense of
            agricultural users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agriculture, which consumes the majority of global freshwater, is therefore caught in a critical dilemma: how to maintain
            essential food production while competing with burgeoning cities for shrinking water resources. Conflicts over water
            allocation are already rising in many regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My research examines how these converging pressures manifest by integrating datasets on climate trends, urban expansion,
            water policies, and agricultural irrigation demand. Through advanced geospatial analysis and modeling, this work informs
            evidence-based policy for balancing food production with urban water security and supports adaptive water governance.
