      My research focuses on irrigation dynamics, water scarcity, and sectoral water competition under climate and socioeconomic change.
      It integrates AI-enabled remote sensing, hydrologic &amp; crop–water modeling, and geospatial analysis to support decision-relevant
      pathways for sustainable water and food systems.

      <h2>1) How do fine-scale irrigation dynamics shape environmental sustainability under climate stress?</h2>

      <p>
        Irrigated agriculture, covering only 24% of croplands yet producing 40% of global food, remains the largest consumer of freshwater 
        and a key driver of aquifer and surface water depletion. Despite its central role in food security and sustainability, existing irrigation 
        datasets are coarse in resolution and overlook smallholder regions, limiting their use in precision agriculture and water management.
        My research agenda aims to advance fine-scale global irrigation mapping by extending coverage across the 21st century (2000–present) and 
        incorporating seasonal irrigation dynamics. Building on these fine-scale data, I aim to assess the sustainability tradeoffs of food production. 
        The ultimate goal is to provide decision-relevant tools that connect irrigation management to measurable
        outcomes in water availability and ecosystem resilience.

      <h2>2) How does climate change alter water resources and river systems under growing human pressures?</h2>

      <p>
        Climate change is fundamentally altering hydrological regimes through shifts in temperature, precipitation, river discharge, and sediment dynamics, 
        intensifying pressures on water availability, flood risk, and ecosystem stability—particularly in data-scarce river basins of sub-Saharan Africa, 
        where urban growth, agriculture, and hydraulic infrastructure compound climate stress. This research integrates climate impact assessment, 
        hydrological model uncertainty, and river morphological analysis by combining statistically downscaled regional climate projections 
        with multi-model hydrological simulations and one-dimensional morphological modeling. By aggregating ensemble 
        climate scenarios and linking altered flow regimes to channel and delta responses using remote sensing and geomorphological analysis, 
        the work provides a robust, integrated framework for understanding climate–human interactions in river systems and supports adaptive, 
        evidence-based water resource management.
