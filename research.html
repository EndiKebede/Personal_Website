  <h2>Research agenda</h2>
  <p>
    My research advances data-driven sustainability science at the intersection of water, food, and energy.
    I focus on building open datasets and analytical approaches that help quantify how irrigation and water scarcity
    reshape freshwater resources, agricultural production, and food supply systems.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">

      <h3>Theme 1 — Develop and leverage large-scale environmental datasets</h3>
      <p>
        Many urgent sustainability questions cannot be answered without consistent, high-resolution, and open data.
        I develop datasets that integrate remote sensing, agricultural statistics, and reproducible workflows to enable
        global-to-local assessments of irrigation, cropping patterns, and food-system risks.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>MIRCA-OS</strong>: monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped areas for the 21st century.</li>
        <li><strong>AEI</strong>: global area equipped for irrigation (infrastructure-focused perspective).</li>
        <li>High-resolution irrigation mapping using combined remote sensing + machine learning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Theme 2 — Evolution of global and local water scarcity and its impacts on food production &amp; supply</h3>
      <p>
        Water scarcity is changing in space and time due to climate variability, groundwater depletion, infrastructure,
        and socioeconomic constraints. I quantify how scarcity evolves from global patterns to local hotspots and assess
        how these shifts translate into risks for food production, stability, and supply.

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Global and local risk assessments linking water scarcity to production and supply outcomes.</li>
        <li>Drivers of persistent economic water scarcity and implications for adaptation and investment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card col-12">
      <h3>Theme 3 — Competition for water between sectors</h3>
      <p>
        Water allocation is increasingly shaped by competing demands from agriculture, cities, energy systems, and
        ecosystems. I study cross-sector competition and trade-offs to identify where water conflicts may intensify and
        where policy and management can improve resilience under scarcity.

        <li>Quantifying trade-offs among agricultural, domestic/urban, industrial, and environmental water needs.</li>
        <li>Identifying regions where scarcity-driven competition may reshape food–water outcomes.</li>
